#Task Tracker
Task Tracker is self destructing to-do list application. It allows users to create a daily to-do list and automatically deletes any items still left on the list longer than 7 days.

Created with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

Built with Ruby on Rails. Ruby version 2.3.0. Rails version 4.2.5.

Deployed with Heroku - https://tranquil-chamber-63838.herokuapp.com/

This project was created as part of the BLOC Software Engineering course. This was the second project I completed in the program. Here's a list of what I learned.
*This was the second project I used to install the Devise gem for user authentication. It was good practice and I got it working quickly the second time around.
*

I learned many new to learn how to integrate the Devise and Faker gems, as well as to learn the Rake Utility for automation in Rails.
